                    Welcome to our Deepfake Detection project, a cutting-edge system designed to combat the rising threat of deepfake technology using advanced deep learning techniques. Our goal is to help safeguard the integrity of media and provide tools for detecting manipulated content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project has been developed by a dedicated team of tech enthusiasts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Darshan Hire</li>
                        <li>Dnyandeep Dhande</li>
                        <li>Raj Shivade</li>
                        <li>Parshv Saitwal</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, we have combined our expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning to create a robust solution that accurately identifies deepfakes. We believe that this system will play a crucial role in ensuring the authenticity of digital media and preventing the spread of misinformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for exploring our project, and we look forward to further developing it to meet future challenges in the AI space.
